 //On start I want the game to  auto apply a starting forward momentum.
        //and this will trigger a starting animation "wiggle"
 //I want players to be able to "jump" and "wreak" 
//OnCollision enter && health && bashPower triggered will destroy game object and apply damage to
//to health
      //Decided to let player control forward momentum for the time but later I want the game to auto start that movement
//forward or backward momentum they will gain speed as they go.
//player will need animations tied to speed, health, and ability use
//Ability "bash" is a downward applied force that that is equal to half the speed 
//player is making. obsticals that take enough force will be destroyed 
//obsticals that are destroid by the player obsorb the momentum and so the player is slowed

//Goals:
// #1. Get player to move - Check!
